# Firefly Regression Algorithm
- Firefly Fuzzy Regression Algorithm - Created in (9 Jan 2022).
- Firefly algorithm is one of the most decent algorithms in optimization which could be used for various tasks and biasing weights. It is relatively faster than others just like DE algorithm. So, there was no a proper evolutionary linear regression Matlab code available in the web and I decided to make one. You can use your data. System uses fuzzy logic to create initial model and biases weights into a fit model by Firefly algorithm. You can play with parameters (higher values, more calculation time).
